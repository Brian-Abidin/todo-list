/* 
To-do list; objects that are created 
using factories or constructors/classes
properties should have at least title, description, dueDate, 
and priority.
might be good to include notes and checklist. 
    - should have projects/seperate list of todos
    - on open, default project shows with all their todos
    - users should be able to create new projects and
    chose which project their todos go into.
Seperate application logic from DOM-related stuff
    - creating new todos
    - setting todos as complete
    - changing todo priority
UI should be able to:
    - view all projects
    - view all todos in each project (ex. Title, duedate, and priorities)
    - expand a single todo to see/edit its details
    - delete a todo
